- 👋 Hi, I’m Avery and I enjoy doing analytical research!
- 👀 I’m interested in following my curiosity while expanding my knowledge and skills that will aid in my analytical journey. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and reviewing SQL, r, python, relational databases, tableau, and more as I study for the CompTIA Data+ Certificate. To help along my journey, I have completed the Google Analytics and freeCodeCamp courses.
