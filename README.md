- 👋 Hi, I’m Avery and I enjoy doing analytical research! Here's a couple of projects I've been apart of for the Texas Space Grant Consortium while pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering:
  - [Li-ion Battery Cooling System](http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/challenge/2016/S16/), read more [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApNan...7...25T/abstract)
  - [3D-Ice Printer](http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/challenge/2016/F16/) 
- 👀 I’m interested in following my curiosity while expanding my knowledge and skills that will aid in my analytical journey. 
- 🌱 Currently reviewing and expanding my knowledge on SQL, r, python, relational databases, tableau, and more.
  - 🌱🌱 My goal is study for the [CompTIA Data+ (DA0-001)](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/data) Certification. To help along my journey, I have completed the [Google Analytics Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/69f99f2709f3e067c8358316a8c48e38) and am working on the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) from freeCodeCamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun and exciting that involves web development or data analysis.
